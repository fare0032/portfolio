<!-- REFLECTION OF PORTFOLIO -->

TELL US ABOUT YOUR PROCESS, CHALLENGES YOU FACED DURING DEVELOPMENT AND HOW YOU OVERCAME THOSE CHANGES.
 I first started with the navigation and worked my way down to the rest of the content.
 I faced a couple challenges that include image sizing and text box placement. I did some research and asked my peers for help. I was later able to figure out my mistakes.

WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED BY CREATING YOUR WEB PORTFOLIO?
I've learned that it takes a lot of effort and professionalism to create and work on a portfolio. It also takes a lot of patience as well.
